🎮 Overview 


This game was just a fun beginner project to experiment new mechanics that I learned. 

The theme is about raising awareness to clean the ocean, However it is just a real life project that my freind (carmen) was working on and I took inspiration from it


The game is splitted into Two chapters. Each chapter has its own mechanics, story dialogue, and small challenges.

--> Chapter 1: Detect trash and Clear the water using a radar mechanic.

--> Chapter 2: Solve mini-puzzles to activate special cleaning pipes.
